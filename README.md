# pandas-challenge
This python code uses pandas to analyze the data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. In this code I broke down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

The final code includes each of the following:
### Player Count
* Total Number of Players
### Purchasing Analysis (Total)
* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue
### Gender Demographics
* Percentage and Count of Male Players
* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed
### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
* The below each broken by gender
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender
### Age Demographics
* The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. &lt;10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group
### Top Spenders
* Identifies the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then lists (in a table):
  * SN
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
### Most Popular Items
* Identifies the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then lists (in a table):
  * Item ID
  * Item Name
  * Purchase Count
  * Item Price
  * Total Purchase Value
### Most Profitable Items
* Identifies the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then lists (in a table):
  * Item ID
